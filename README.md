[![CI workflow](https://github.com/oscartbeaumont/vite-plugin-relay/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/oscartbeaumont/vite-plugin-relay/actions)

Add relay support to your [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) projects.

Created with the help of [@Brendonovich](https://github.com/Brendonovich) and thanks to [@kesne](https://github.com/kesne) for adding [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) support.

## Usage

Add `vite-plugin-relay` and `relay` to your project.

```bash
yarn add react-relay relay-runtime
yarn add -D relay-compiler vite-plugin-relay
```

Next setup NPM scripts in the `package.json`. One is required for Vite and the other for the Relay Compiler

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "vite",
  "relay": "relay-compiler"
},
```

Next setup `relay.config.js` more information about this can be found in the [official relay docs](https://relay.dev/docs/getting-started/installation-and-setup/#set-up-relay-with-a-single-config-file).

Finally add `vite-plugin-relay` to your Vite configuration (`vite.config.ts`).

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import relay from "vite-plugin-relay";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [..., relay],
});
```

Now your project is setup to use Relay with Vite!

## Server Side Rendering

If you are planning to use this plugin with server side rendering you may need to define `window`. You could do this by putting the following snippet in your [`entry-server.js`](https://vitejs.dev/guide/ssr.html#source-structure) file.

```js
if (typeof (window as any).global === 'undefined') {
  (window as any).global = globalThis;
}
```
